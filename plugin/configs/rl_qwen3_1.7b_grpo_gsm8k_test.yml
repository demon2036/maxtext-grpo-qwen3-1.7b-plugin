# Plugin RL config: Qwen3-1.7B GRPO on GSM8K (10-step smoke test)
#
# - Inherits upstream MaxText RL config.
# - NOTE: Upstream MaxText restricts `model_name` to a fixed allowlist, and Tunix
#   requires `model_name` to be present in `HF_MODEL_CONFIGS` for vLLM weight mapping.
#   We therefore set `model_name=qwen3-0.6b` (allowlisted) but override its model
#   config locally under `plugin/configs/models/qwen3-0.6b.yml` to match Qwen3-1.7B.
#
# NOTE: Pass `run_name=... base_output_directory=...` via CLI.
